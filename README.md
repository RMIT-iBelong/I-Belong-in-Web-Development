# Please Read Me!

This is a read me file that tells a developer important information about the start up code they are using.

## What pages can I edit code?
The pages that you have ***free reign*** to edit are:

* pages/interview.html
* pages/animation.html
* css/style.css
* scripts/script.js

## What pages should I avoid editing code?
The pages that you *should* avoid editing are:

* worksheet.md *(this has tasks to complete during this course)*
* index.html
* pages/resources/css.html
* pages/resources/html.html
* pages/resources/js.html
* css/index.css
* css/w3.css

The reason you should avoid editing these pages is because we have designed them for the program and to help with learning this course in a virtual environment. Of course, *after the program*, you are able to edit these pages as you please.

## Resources / Help
The index page has three buttons: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Each of these buttons takes you to a page with external links to a learning website called [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). These links have been hand picked to what is most relevant to this program.

## Images on sites
